## UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM
1. Simplify it in your words.
2. What are the inputs?
3. What are the outputs?
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? (Do I have enough information to solve the problem?)

## EXPLORE EXAMPLES
1. Start with simple examples, then build up complexity.
2. Try empty and invalid inputs.

## BREAKDOWN
1. Explicitly write out the steps you need to take.
2. Solve a simpler problem if you can't solve the actual problem.
3. Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do. Temporarily ignore that difficulty and then incorporate that difficulty back in.

## LOOK BACK AND REFACTOR
1. Check the result.
2. Can you derive the result differently?
3. Can you understand it at a glance?
4. Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
5. Can you improve the performance of your solution?
6. Can you think of other ways to refactor?
7. How have other people solved the problem?
