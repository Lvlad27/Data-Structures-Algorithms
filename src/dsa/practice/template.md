## UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM

### Simplify it in your words.

### What are the inputs?

### What are the outputs?

### Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? (Do I have enough information to solve the problem?)

## EXPLORE EXAMPLES

### Start with simple examples, then build up complexity.

### Try empty and invalid inputs.

## BREAKDOWN

### Explicitly write out the steps you need to take.

### Solve a simpler problem if you can't solve the actual problem.

### Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do. Temporarily ignore that difficulty and then incorporate that difficulty back in.

## LOOK BACK AND REFACTOR

### Check the result.

### Can you derive the result differently?

### Can you understand it at a glance?

### Can you use the result or method for some other problem?

### Can you improve the performance of your solution?

### Can you think of other ways to refactor?

### How have other people solved the problem?
