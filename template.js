/**
 * UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM
 * 1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
 * 2. What are the inputs?
 * 3. What are the outputs?
 * 4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? (Do I have enough information to solve the problem?)
 *
 * EXPLORE EXAMPLES
 * 1. Start with simple examples.
 * 2. Progress to make more complex examples.
 * 3. Explore examples with empty inputs.
 * 4. Explore examples with invalid inputs.
 *
 * BREAKDOWN
 * 1. Explicitly write out the steps you need to take. (basic)
 * 2. Solve a simpler problem if you can't solve the actual problem.
 * 3. Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do. Temporarily ignore that difficulty and then incorporate that difficulty back in.
 *
 * LOOK BACK AND REFACTOR
 * 1. Can you check the result?
 * 2. Can you derive the result differently?
 * 3. Can you understand it at a glance?
 * 4. Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
 * 5. Can you improve the performance of your solution?
 * 6. Can you think of other ways to refactor?
 * 7. How have other people solved the problem?

/**
* UNDERSTAND
* Restate problem: simplify it in your words
* Know your data: What goes in (inputs) and what comes out (outputs)?
* Enough info? Can you solve it with what you have?

* EXPLORE
* Start simple: Easy examples, then build up complexity.
* Test the edges: Try empty and invalid inputs.

* BREAKDOWN
* List the steps: Write down what you need to do.
* Simplify further: If stuck, try a smaller, similar problem.
* Isolate the core: Focus on the toughest part, make it easier, then add it back in.

 * LOOK BACK AND REFACTOR
 * Can you check the result?
 * Can you derive the result differently?
 * Can you understand it at a glance?
 * Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
 * Can you improve the performance of your solution?
 * Can you think of other ways to refactor?
 * How have other people solved the problem?
